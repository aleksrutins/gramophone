Let's write a basic OpMode!

## The Basics

In order to write an OpMode, you need to create an OpMode class. OpMode classes generally extend from the `com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.LinearOpMode` class, and implement the `runOpMode()` method.

Inside the `runOpMode` method, most OpModes have three stages:

1. **Initialization**

   This is the code at the very start of the `runOpMode` method. This code is called when the driver presses the "Init" button on the Driver Station, and is generally the place to initialize hardware and do other pre-game tasks.

2. **Pre-Loop**

   After the Initialization phase, your OpMode should call the `waitForStart` method to wait until the driver presses "Start".
   After that, it should use an `if(opModeIsActive())` block to make sure that no emergency stop has been requested.
   At the beginning of that `if` block is where you should put code intended to run once. This can, in some cases &mdash; autonomous OpModes being the most common scenario &mdash; be your entire OpMode.

3. **Loop**

   If your OpMode is a TeleOp that responds to user input, below the pre-loop code should be a `while(opModeIsActive())` loop, which repeats until the OpMode is stopped. Here is where you should respond to user input, check sensors, and, for a TeleOp, run the main code of your OpMode.

A basic scaffold for a TeleOp with all three stages:
```kotlin
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.LinearOpMode
import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp

@TeleOp(name = "Op Mode Name")
class OpModeName : LinearOpMode() {
    override fun runOpMode() {
        // Put initialization here.
        waitForStart()
        if(opModeIsActive()) {
            // Put pre-loop code here.
            while(opModeIsActive()) {
                // Put loop code here.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And for an autonomous, with only initialization and pre-loop:
```kotlin
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.LinearOpMode
import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp

@TeleOp(name = "Op Mode Name")
class OpModeName : LinearOpMode() {
    override fun runOpMode() {
        // Put initialization here.
        waitForStart()
        if(opModeIsActive()) {
            // Put the OpMode routine here.
        }
    }
}
```

## Subassembly Abstractions
In our (the [Manchester Machine Makers](https://manchestermachinemakers.org)') codebase, we use [subassembly abstractions](subassembly-abstractions) for our hardware.
Since our hardware requirements change based on the season, we'll explore the `DriveBase` abstraction here.

The `DriveBase` abstraction has [way too many methods](https://github.com/ManchesterMachineMakers/RobotController/blob/season/next/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/subassemblies/DriveBase.kt), but there are only a few that we'll cover here: `setRunMode`, `setTravelDirection`, and most importantly, `go`.

`setRunMode` and `setTravelDirection` should be relatively familiar to those having used Blocks, as they are very similar to their `DcMotor` counterparts; however, there are a couple of significant differences:
1. They affect all of the motors on the robot.
2. `setTravelDirection`, instead of using a `DcMotorEx.Direction`, uses a `DriveBase.TravelDirection`.

`DriveBase.TravelDirection` is relatively simple; it has a number of possible directions, but they should generally be self-explanatory:
```kotlin
enum class TravelDirection {
    base, forward, reverse, pivotLeft, pivotRight, strafeLeft, strafeLeftForward, strafeLeftBackward, strafeRight, strafeRightForward, strafeRightBackward, 
    @Deprecated("Newer drive bases do not support pitching")
    pitch
}
```

The only one that may require explanation is `base`: all it does is set all motors to run forward.

`go` is slightly less similar to the standard library, and complicated mainly due to its egregious number of overloads. However, the only overload we'll be using here is `go(powerLevel: Float)`, which sets all motors to the specified power level.

To make the robot go forward, you can initialize it by setting the run mode to `DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER` and the travel direction to `base`. Then, you can run the drive base forward by setting the power level to a number between 0 and 1. To stop it, just set the power level to zero.

### Initializing Subassembly Abstractions
However, you can't just slap some `DriveBase` calls in your code and call it good. First, you have to initialize the drive base by giving it the required hardware.

This is done automatically through the `RobotConfig.initHardwareMaps` method, which will automatically initialize all detected subassemblies.
To call it, just put this line in your initialization stage:
```kotlin
RobotConfig.initHardwareMaps(hardwareMap, gamepad1, gamepad2)
```

Then, you should be ready to use the various subassemblies in your code.

Now, try to put all this together by completing the challenge below. Once you think you have an answer, you can check it by clicking "Show Answer".

<CodeChallenge client:visible text="Write an opmode using the DriveBase abstraction that runs the robot forward at half power.">
```kotlin
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.LinearOpMode
import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp

@TeleOp(name = "Hallway Run")
class HallwayRun : LinearOpMode() {
    override fun runOpMode() {
        RobotConfig.initHardwareMaps(hardwareMap, gamepad1, gamepad2)
        DriveBase.setRunMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER)
        DriveBase.setTravelDirection(DriveBase.TravelDirection.base)

        waitForStart()
        if(opModeIsActive()) {
            while(opModeIsActive()) {
                DriveBase.go(0.5) // this power level doesn't really matter
            }
        }
    }
}
```
